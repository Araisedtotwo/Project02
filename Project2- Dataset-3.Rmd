#### Import and Rename Variables in Federal Spending Data

```{r}
# Read the csv file from GitHub with the table data
# Rename the columns to make them easier to use
df_csv <- read.csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Araisedtotwo/Project02/main/DataUSACart.csv", header = TRUE) %>%
  as_tibble() %>%
  rename(id = ID.Geography , 
         agencyid= ID.Agency ,
         amount = Obligation.Amount..2017.) %>%
  print()
# 6557 obs and 5 vars
```

#### Creating AWS MySQL Connection & Reading Data from MySQL
```{r,warning=FALSE}
mysqlconnection = dbConnect(MySQL(), user='root', password='xxxx', dbname ='federal_spending',host='aws-movie-rating.cc7r4c0owv8u.us-east-1.rds.amazonaws.com')
result = dbSendQuery(mysqlconnection,"SELECT `ID Geography` AS id,`Geography`,`ID Agency`AS agencyid ,`Agency`,`Obligation Amount (2017)` AS amount FROM federal_spending.fedspend")
df=fetch(result,n= -1)
head(df)
```


#### Clean data

```{r}
# Remove amounts that are in -ve
df1 <- df %>%
  filter(amount > 0)
head(df1)
# 6158 obs and 5 vars
```

#### Let us sort data by spending amount and look at the summary of all variables
```{r}
df2 <- df1 %>%
  arrange(amount)
summary(df2)
```

#### Calculate the overall spending by State 

```{r,warning=FALSE}
state_spending <- df2 %>% group_by(Geography) %>% summarize(sum_state = sum(amount)) %>%
  arrange(sum_state, Geography)
tail(state_spending)
# Wyoming has the highest Federal Spending at $186,831,546,017
```

#### Calculate the overall spending by Agency 

```{r,warning=FALSE}
agency_spending <- df2 %>% group_by(Agency) %>% summarize(sum_agency = sum(amount)) %>%
  arrange(desc(sum_agency, Agency))
head(agency_spending)
# Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services at $687,665,667,131 is the highest spending agency
```

#### Plotting 5 highest spending states
